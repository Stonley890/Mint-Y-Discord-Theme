## Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have a way to apply CSS stylesheets to Discord. Here are some ones you can try:

- [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) (I use this one)
- [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app)
- [Replugged](https://replugged.dev)

Find the themes setting and follow the directions to add this theme.

Theme file (right-click and *Save As* or import from URL): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stonley890/Mint-Y-Discord-Theme/refs/heads/main/Mint-Y.theme.css

## Caveats
- The activity button is removed.
- The Nitro gift button is removed.
- Channel scrollbar is invisible.
